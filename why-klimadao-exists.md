# Why Klima Protocol Exists

### Why Klima Protocol Exists

Klima Protocol was created to solve a structural problem: carbon markets are essential—but they’re inefficient, fragmented, and inaccessible.

Despite decades of international commitments, emissions have not decisively declined. Carbon markets—one of the key tools for accelerating climate action—are maturing but still constrained by a lack of transparency, high transaction costs, and limited liquidity.

Klima Protocol exists to address these challenges by introducing programmable, onchain infrastructure that enables:

#### Transparent Pricing

Project developers are often undersold. Klima ensures that carbon credit prices are determined through governance-driven, real-time market signals—so that credits reflect their true value.

#### Seamless Market Access

Today’s carbon markets are full of intermediaries, inefficiencies, and data silos. Klima removes these barriers by acting as a decentralized counterparty and infrastructure layer for buyers, sellers, and integrators alike.

#### Automated Carbon Retirement

Carbon credits can be retired directly onchain—transparently, trustlessly, and at scale—unlocking verifiable environmental outcomes without relying on manual processes.

#### Composable Tools for Builders

Klima isn’t just a market maker, it’s infrastructure. Through smart contracts and API webhooks, Klima enables developers to build new climate-aligned products, services, and integrations on top of its core system.

### The Klima 2.0 Approach

Klima 2.0 is a rules-based, dual-token system that enables decentralized carbon pricing, portfolio balancing, and programmable retirement. It replaces opacity and middlemen with a transparent, participatory system where:

* Capital, pricing, and retirement flows are coordinated onchain
* Tokens reflect real carbon exposure and collective governance
* Protocol fees are redistributed entirely to users, not intermediaries

This creates a self-balancing asset management system for carbon—one where incentives, supply, and demand interact seamlessly to drive measurable climate impact.

> Klima exists to transform carbon markets from manual, high-cost systems into scalable, transparent, and fair infrastructure for global sustainability.
