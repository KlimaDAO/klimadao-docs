# Use Cases and Value Proposition

Klima Protocol provides a blockchain-based capital system purpose-built for carbon markets.

At its core, Klima Protocol exists to serve two foundational objectives:

* **Transparent carbon pricing** – so that project developers are not undersold and buyers access the market efficiently with verifiable, real-time pricing.
* **Access to carbon markets** – by abstracting away fragmentation, intermediaries, and complexity, Klima serves as a decentralized counterparty for both buyers and sellers, making climate action programmable and accessible at scale.

### Value Proposition

#### Carbon Market Infrastructure

Klima Protocol serves as a capital, liquidity, and execution layer for tokenized carbon markets. It introduces a formal mechanism for:

* Onchain carbon asset pricing based on collective governance and market signals;
* Frictionless market access – instant settlement, token-based capital flows, and self-custody trading of carbon assets;
* Smart contract execution that eliminates intermediaries, reduces overhead, and enables capital-efficient operations across carbon supply and demand;
* 24/7 carbon index (ETF) that allows economic actors to be exposed to the spot and forwards (ex-ante) carbon markets.

#### Utility Layer for Tokenized Carbon

Klima 2.0 is designed for composability. It allows stakeholders to directly interface with the protocol across multiple functions:

* Governance: Token holders vote on which carbon classes are supported and how they’re weighted in the portfolio;
* Liquidity provisioning: Stakeholders contribute capital to carbon-backed liquidity pools and receive dynamic yield based on system parameters;
* Programmable infrastructure: Developers and integrators can leverage Klima’s smart contracts, Retirement Aggregator, and retirement tools to build carbon-enabled products and services.

These components form an infrastructure and economic layer that transforms how capital and carbon interact, turning passive carbon exposure into an actively governed, yield-generating market structure.

### Diverse Ecosystem of Carbon Market Actors&#x20;

Klima 2.0 is designed to serve a diverse ecosystem of carbon market actors: each with their incentives, infrastructure needs, and touchpoints with the protocol. This guide helps map user types to the protocol’s features and value.
