# Welcome to Klima Protocol

Klima Protocol is an open blockchain-enabled infrastructure for climate finance.\
\
At its core, Klima Protocol is an ecosystem for pricing, managing, and retiring carbon credits onchain, built to increase transparency, liquidity, and access across global carbon markets.

🌍 Mission: To make carbon markets more efficient, accessible, and verifiable by embedding climate finance into programmable, onchain systems.

🛠️ How: Through a decentralized protocol governed by smart contracts, collective decision-making, and programmable carbon markets.

🚀 Why: Because we believe carbon markets must evolve to meet the climate challenge, with tools that are efficient, transparent, and built to last.

### What Is Klima Protocol?

Klima Protocol provides a blockchain-based capital system purpose-built for carbon markets.

At its core, Klima Protocol exists to serve two foundational objectives:

* Transparent carbon pricing – so that project developers are not undersold and buyers access the market efficiently with verifiable, real-time pricing.
* Access to carbon markets – by abstracting away fragmentation, intermediaries, and complexity, Klima serves as a decentralized counterparty for both buyers and sellers, making climate action programmable and accessible at scale.

### The Liquidity Hub for Carbon Onchain

Klima Protocol serves as a capital, liquidity, and execution layer for tokenized carbon markets. It introduces a formal mechanism for:

* Onchain carbon asset pricing based on collective governance and market signals.
* Frictionless market access – instant settlement, token-based capital flows, and self-custody trading of carbon assets.
* Smart contract execution that eliminates intermediaries, reduces overhead, and enables capital-efficient operations across carbon supply and demand.
* 24/7 carbon index (ETF) that allows economic actors to be exposed to the spot and forwards (ex-ante) carbon markets

### Utility Layer for Tokenized Carbon

Klima 2.0 is designed for composability. It allows stakeholders to directly interface with the protocol across multiple functions:

* Governance: Token holders vote on which carbon classes are supported and how they’re weighted in the portfolio.
* Liquidity provisioning: Stakeholders contribute capital to carbon-backed liquidity pools and receive a dynamic yield based on system parameters.
* Programmable infrastructure: Developers and integrators can leverage Klima’s smart contracts, Retirement Aggregator, and retirement tools to build carbon-enabled products and services.

These components form an infrastructure and economic layer that transforms how capital and carbon interact, turning passive carbon exposure into an actively governed, yield-generating market structure.

### What’s New in Klima 2.0

> * 🪙 Dual-token model: kVCM for utility and K2 for governance & risk balancing
> * 🔁 Automated pricing mechanisms: powered by system signals, not central control
> * 🧬 Economic governance: fully decentralized influence over pricing and risk
> * 💥 Composable APIs: for seamless integration into fintech and climate platforms
