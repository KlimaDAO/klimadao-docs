# Welcome to KlimaDAO

KlimaDAO is an open infrastructure for climate finance, built to address the inefficiencies of global carbon markets.

Today, carbon markets are critical to channeling capital into climate solutions, yet they remain slow, opaque, fragmented, and burdened by trust gaps. These barriers limit liquidity, delay transactions, and make it harder for environmental projects to access fair funding.

KlimaDAO exists to change this.

We provide a rules-based system for pricing, managing, and retiring carbon credits that improves transparency, accelerates market access, and strengthens confidence for all participants.

### What Is KlimaDAO?

KlimaDAO is a market infrastructure layer purpose-built for climate finance. It focuses on two core objectives:

#### ✅ Transparent Carbon Pricing

* Ensuring climate projects receive fair value while giving buyers access to real-time, verifiable market prices.

#### ✅ Access to Carbon Markets

* Reducing fragmentation and complexity by creating a shared infrastructure that connects capital to carbon supply efficiently and at scale.

### The Liquidity Hub for Carbon Onchain

Klima 2.0 introduces an enhanced framework designed for the needs of modern carbon finance. It serves as the capital, liquidity, and execution layer for carbon transactions, enabling:

* Transparent pricing of carbon assets through governance-driven market signals
* Faster market access, with near-instant settlement and efficient capital flows
* Lower operational costs by replacing intermediaries with standardized processes
* Continuous market exposure via a 24/7 carbon index covering spot and forward (ex-ante) markets

### Utility Layer for Tokenized Carbon

Klima 2.0 is modular and open, enabling different actors in the carbon economy to interact directly with its infrastructure.

* Governance: Stakeholders influence which categories of credits are supported and how they’re prioritized.
* Liquidity Provisioning: Capital providers earn returns based on market activity and performance.
* Integration Tools: Service providers and platforms can use Klima’s APIs and tools—such as the Retirement Aggregator—for automated credit retirement, transparent reporting, and innovative climate finance products.

This transforms passive carbon exposure into an actively governed, outcome-driven market system.

### What’s New in Klima 2.0

* Dual-token framework — separating market utility from governance and risk management
* Automated pricing mechanisms — informed by market activity and transparent rules
* Economic governance — stakeholders shape asset prioritization and market behavior
* Integration-ready APIs’ webhooks — enabling seamless connection to financial platforms, corporate systems, and sustainability solutions
