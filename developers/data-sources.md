## World Bank Climate Warehouse

Envisioned to be a [global resource for all carbon credit and allowance programs](https://www.theclimatewarehouse.org/about).&#x20;

Still under development, it is currently running as a Proof-of-Concept on Chia Network: [https://app.climatewarehouse.chia.net/#/projects](https://app.climatewarehouse.chia.net/#/projects)
