# Initial Network State

**Our initial goal is not to find a stable carbon price.** It is to provide an intuitive way for Web3 users to engage with the carbon markets, vote on what the 'crypto-carbon' market should look like, and be rewarded for participation. Through policy and voting, the protocol will be tuned to optimize for different carbon market trends over time.&#x20;

In the near-term, the main tradeoff is volatility versus stability and consistency. With volatility comes growth; this is what we want early on. Towards the middle of the century, we anticipate more stability as KLIMA approaches equilibrium with supply and demand in the carbon markets.&#x20;

With tight policy, KlimaDAO should deliver on the near-term goals of reducing carbon, incentivizing participation in carbon markets, and building the infrastructure to increase liquidity and transparency in the carbon markets.&#x20;

With scale, we will create a new, regenerative monetary system.&#x20;

**Alpha State**

The initial network features the following:

* **A one-way treasury:** money goes in, and is directed immediately to carbon projects.
* **The bonding contract:** through which reserves of BCT, LP and KLIMA tokens are increased.&#x20;
* **The staking contract:** where KLIMA rewards are distributed.&#x20;

On Epoch 0, the initial supply was \~251k KLIMA. \~57k came from the IDO, 133k came from the LBP, and \~81k came from the alchemist reward program. &#x20;
