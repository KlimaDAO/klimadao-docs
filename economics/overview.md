# Overview

$KLIMA is designed as a utility token, central to providing liquidity in the carbon market. It plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Market (CM) by acting as a means of exchange and index of carbon projects.

This section outlines the operational mechanics, the dynamics, and the purpose of $KLIMA.
