# Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL)

**Understanding Liquidity in Markets**

Liquidity is the lifeblood of any efficient market, enabling seamless trades without significantly affecting the asset's price. Traditional carbon markets often operate over-the-counter (OTC), predominantly featuring ask prices with limited visibility on bids. This structure can lead to inefficiencies, including price opacity, large price spreads, and illiquidity. In contrast, the KLIMA token, through its integration with Automated Market Makers (AMMs), actively participates in both bidding and asking across narrow price spreads, enabling a transparent and fluid market environment.

In decentralized finance (DeFi), liquidity is facilitated differently than in traditional markets. Platforms like Uniswap and Sushiswap have pioneered the use of on-chain Liquidity Pools (LPs), which are smart contracts containing pairs of assets, such as KLIMA and USDC. The principle of X\*Y = K underpins these liquidity pools, ensuring that the product of the quantities of the two assets remains constant, thereby defining the relationship between supply and demand.

KLIMA connects environmental assets with on-chain financial primitives that can scale environmental markets via liquid and transparent market infrastructure.

**Enhancements with Concentrated Liquidity**\

Uniswap's introduction of concentrated liquidity functionality marks a significant advancement in capital efficiency within AMMs. This innovation allows liquidity providers to allocate their capital to specific price ranges, maximizing capital efficiency and enabling more strategic liquidity management. This feature is particularly beneficial in optimizing the liquidity of KLIMA/CARBON pools, ensuring that capital is utilized where it's most needed, thereby reducing slippage and enhancing market stability.

KLIMA has launched a pool on [Sushiswap](https://dexscreener.com/polygon/0x5786b267d35f9d011c4750e0b0ba584e1fdbead1), where users can optionally toggle a “green fee” that will automatically make a transaction carbon neutral.

KLIMA has also launched a concentrated liquidity pool on [Uniswap](https://dexscreener.com/polygon/0xba3b82585355ccd047a96b86aabe256d181c23d2), augmenting the liquidity on Sushiswap and allowing for more capital efficient transactions.

**KLIMA/CARBON Liquidity Pools**

KLIMA has six primary KLIMA/CARBON liquidity pools, and more will be constructed as carbon continues to be tokenized.

Along with the primary [KLIMA/USDC](https://app.sushi.com/swap?tokens=0x4e78011Ce80ee02d2c3e649Fb657E45898257815\&tokens=0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174\&chainId=137) pool.

These pools are crucial for creating a liquid on-chain market for carbon assets, allowing for efficient trading and price discovery. By supporting liquidity across multiple carbon tokens, Klima not only supports a broad range of environmental projects but also enhances the resilience and depth of the market.

**Conclusion**

The strategic management of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and the adoption of concentrated liquidity functionality represent significant advancements in Klima’'s approach to market liquidity. By owning and efficiently managing liquidity across multiple KLIMA/CARBON pools, KLIMA ensures an efficient, stable, and resilient market for carbon assets, aligning with its mission to facilitate a liquid and accessible Carbon Market.
