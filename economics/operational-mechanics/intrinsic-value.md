# Intrinsic Value

The intrinsic value (IV) of the KLIMA token is a fundamental operational mechanic that underpins its role as an algorithmic reserve currency for environmental markets. This section delves into the principles and implications of the intrinsic value that each KLIMA token holds.

**Foundation of Intrinsic Value**

At the core of KLIMA's design is the principle that every token is backed by at least one carbon tonne. This backing not only establishes a tangible value for the token but also aligns KLIMA's utility with environmental sustainability efforts. The KLIMA treasury, holding tonnes from hundreds of diverse carbon offset projects, acts as a de-facto index of carbon projects. This unique feature ensures that the value of KLIMA is directly connected to a broad spectrum of environmental initiatives, reflecting the health and diversity of the carbon market.

**Axioms of Intrinsic Value**

1. Guaranteed Minimum Value: The intrinsic value provides a guaranteed price floor for the KLIMA token, ensuring that there is always a minimum value associated with each token. This floor is established by the backing of at least one carbon tonne per KLIMA, setting a tangible benchmark for its value.
2. Supply Management: As the steward of the KLIMA token, the protocol functions akin to an algorithmic asset manager, with exclusive authority to mint or burn tokens codified via smart-contracts. This algorithmic control allows for adjustments to the token's supply based on real-time economic data, ensuring its value remains aligned with the intrinsic value and the broader objectives of the carbon market.

**Implications of Intrinsic Value**

The intrinsic value mechanic ensures that the KLIMA token remains a stable and reliable asset within the carbon market. By directly tying the token's value to tangible environmental assets, KLIMA serves as a bridge between digital finance and real-world sustainability efforts. This foundational principle guarantees that KLIMA's supply and market operations are always conducted with a view towards environmental impact and market stability, ensuring that KLIMA remains an effective tool for liquidity provisioning and a meaningful representation of the carbon credit market.
