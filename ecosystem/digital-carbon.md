## What is digital carbon?

The term 'digital carbon' refers to a carbon credit generated by a carbon projects that has been bridged from an off-chain carbon registry and tokenized, so that the credit now exists solely on a public blockchain (e.g. Polygon). In being brought on chain, digital carbon inherits the immutability, transparency, and trust of the underlying blockchain database.

Just like off-chain carbon credits, a digital carbon credit represents a verified metric ton of carbon removed or avoided by an individual carbon reduction project at a certain point in time. Also like traditional credits, digital carbon can be bought, sold, and retired – but with much greater transparency and ease. A further advantage of digital carbon is that it is a 'money Lego' – it is programmable and can be used to power applications, enable new use cases, and ultimately, dramatically scale financing to carbon reduction projects.

## Carbon Projects

### What is a carbon credit?&#x20;

Carbon credits are issued to verified carbon projects that demonstrably remove or avoid greenhouse gas emissions. This includes initiatives like renewable energy, forest conservation, soil carbon enhancement, and industrial emission capture. Each verified ton of CO2-e avoided or removed translates to a credit, enabling tracking, trading, and financial incentives for emission reduction projects. It also lets individuals and businesses offset their impact by purchasing and retiring these credits.

{% hint style="info" %}
The term "carbon dioxide equivalent" (CO2-e) refers to the summation of multiple greenhouse gasses based on each gasses global warming potential (GWP). The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 tonne of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2). For instance, methane has a GWP about 28 times that of CO2.
{% endhint %}

Carbon credits are involved in both the **compliance market** and **voluntary carbon market (VCM)**.

**Voluntary carbon market (VCM):** Businesses and individuals driven by sustainability goals can choose to offset their emissions. Traditionally, they would purchase credits from various projects through carbon registries like [Verra](https://verra.org/), [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/), [International Carbon Registry (ICR)](https://app.gitbook.com/u/vqOBD8IWGsflzqskzl1cgXwDvcC2), [Puro Registry](https://puro.earth/), [American Carbon Registry (ACR)](https://acrcarbon.org/) and [Climate Action Reserve (CAR)](https://www.climateactionreserve.org/) etc. not linked to specific state-mandated compliance schemes.

In the voluntary markets, carbon projects are required to follow specific methodology standards and are subjected to a strong verification process from carbon credit registries to ensure credit quality and impact.

**Compliance market:** These operate under mandatory government regulations like cap-and-trade systems. Entities exceeding their allocated emission limits must purchase credits from verified projects to comply. Such credits are issued and tracked through government-sanctioned registries.

#### Digital Carbon Market (DCM)

The VCM has been around for decades, but has long suffered from lack of access, opacity, illiquidity, and high transaction fees. KlimaDAO aims to change that by migrating the VCM on-chain, where all market participants can benefit from the advantages of distributed ledger technology. This new, open, and public blockchain-enabled version of the VCM is referred to as the **Digital Carbon Market (DCM)**.

KLIMA is a central pillar of both the KlimaDAO protocol and the wider Digital Carbon Market (DCM). The DCM infrastructure that KlimaDAO has built brings unparalleled transparency and efficiency to the carbon markets. Built on top of public blockchains, the infrastructure inherits blockchain’s trust, security, and interoperability.

### What are examples of carbon projects?&#x20;

1. **Nature-based carbon sequestration**. Biological sequestration absorbs CO2 emissions through the growth of vegetation and the continued storage of some of the carbon in plant tissues and organic materials derived from plant tissues (e.g. stored in the soil). An example project is the [restoration of degraded mangrove landscapes in Myanmar](https://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/project\_details/1764). Other examples include biochar (long term carbon storage from biological sources), and afforestation initiatives (e.g. tree planting on degraded landscapes).
2. **Renewable energy**. Renewable Energy projects include hydro, wind, and photovoltaic solar power, solar hot water and biomass power and heat production. Many renewable energy projects have high up-front capital costs, although they may offer high rates of return, and their operating costs are often minimal once built. Carbon credits help support these projects by providing an additional revenue stream to offset their high up-front capital costs. This [wind energy power project in India](https://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/project\_details/1788) is an example and helps reduce 182,016 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent a year by replacing polluting fossil fuel power plants.
3. **Methane capture**. Methane’s global warming potential is about 28 times greater than that of CO2, and thus preventing methane emissions can have significant environmental benefits. Methane is emitted by landfills, during wastewater treatment, in natural gas and petroleum systems, from agricultural activities (livestock and rice cultivation), and during coal mining. Methane is basically ‘natural gas’ and can therefore be captured and used as a source of energy. Such projects include those that capture and purify methane in wastewater treatment plants or landfills and use it for electricity production or the production of another form of energy. The [West Star North Dairy](https://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/project\_details/642) project in California, USA is an example project that captures methane from a dairy farm and uses it for energy.
4. **Energy Efficiency and Impact.** The types of projects which would qualify for the EEIMP pool include clean cookstoves, clean drinking water, and small biogas plants. [KlimaDAO ratified 250,000 USDC in funding to support the development of the Improved Cookstoves project in Bangladesh in collaboration with SCB Group. ](https://snapshot.org/#/klimadao.eth/proposal/0x930b6004d537544bd996fd2e90d07fb1c55e37010cb3cf59d88a20f9bca85036)The funding enables the issuance of 31,250 Gold Standard certified carbon credits between 2023 and 2025, with the goal of providing liquidity for consumers within the Digital Carbon Market (DCM) on the Polygon blockchain.

## Tokenized Carbon Credits

In order to make use of carbon credits on the blockchain as digital carbon, carbon credits must be "tokenized" or bridged onto the blockchain from a traditional carbon registry via a carbon bridge. While the technical details of each bridge may differ, the process of bridging and tokenizing carbon credits is generally similar.

Carbon credit holders like project developers can initiate the bridging process by submitting verified carbon credits to their chosen bridge. Upon successful transfer, the bridge seamlessly tokenizes the credits, translating each verified tonne of carbon into a unique digital token on the blockchain. Key characteristics of the carbon credits are brought on-chain when it is transformed into a tokenized digital carbon credit, including:

* Project Name
* Serial Number
* Project type (renewable energy, forest carbon project, blue carbon, etc.)
* Vintage Year
* Verification Standard

This process ensures you can always verify the integrity and provenance of the credit. Different tokenized credits can represent carbon credits from different projects, e.g. a forestry project in Brazil or a soil carbon project from the US.

### Carbon Bridges

Carbon bridges serve as a vital link connecting traditional carbon credit registries like Verra or Gold Standard with blockchains like Polygon.
