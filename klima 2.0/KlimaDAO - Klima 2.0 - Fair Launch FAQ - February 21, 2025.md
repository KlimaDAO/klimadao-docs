# KlimaDAO 2.0 Fair Launch - Intro FAQ  

*"Markets are superb at setting prices, but incapable of recognizing the price of their success."*  

## What is Klima 2.0?  
Klima 2.0 is a redesigned decentralized carbon market aimed at enhancing carbon pricing, retirement, and offset mechanisms.  
The new model introduces:  
- A **bond market**  
- An **economic governance token ($KLIMAX)**  
- A **synthetic pricing model for carbon credits**  
- An **Automated Asset Manager (AAM)** for pricing and liquidity of tokenized carbon assets via $KLIMA  

## What is an Automated Asset Manager?  
An **Automated Asset Manager (AAM)** is a collection of smart contracts that facilitate pricing and trading of assets.  
Klima applies this technology to carbon credits, allowing issuers to access deep liquidity via synthetic pricing of real-world assets (RWAs) using **$KLIMA and $KLIMAX**.  

## What is the Fair Launch?  
The Fair Launch is a program transitioning the legacy **$KLIMA** token to Klima 2.0.  

- **$KLIMA holders stake their tokens** to receive the new Klima 2.0 tokens ($KLIMA + $KLIMAX).  
- New **$KLIMA is distributed pro-rata** based on staked amounts.  
- **$KLIMAX is distributed pro-rata** based on **points accrued** (stake early & longer = more points).  
- **Unstaked $KLIMA will not receive new $KLIMA** at relaunch.  

## What if I don't stake?  
Unstaked **$KLIMA** tokens will **retain their 1:1 BCT backing** but will **not receive new Klima 2.0 tokens**.  

## Why wouldn't I stake?  
To maintain an option on short-term $KLIMA price volatility.  

## What happens to legacy $KLIMA after relaunch?  
- **Staked tokens** are **locked** and **replaced with new allocations**.  
- **Unstaked tokens** maintain **1:1 BCT backing** and can still be **retired or traded**.  

## When does staking start?  
Details will be announced on the **official Discord and Twitter**.  

## When does staking end?  
Staking ends when the Klima 2.0 protocol is **ready for deployment (estimated Q3 2025).**  

## Can I add more $KLIMA to my stake over time?  
Yes!

## How are points calculated?  

### Base Points Calculation  
\[
\text{Daily Points} = \text{Staked Amount} \times e^{(0.00274 \times \text{Days})} \times \text{Entry Bonus}
\]  

**Entry Bonus:**  
- **2.0x** for Week 1 participants  
- **1.5x** for Week 2 participants  
- **1.0x** for all subsequent participants  

#### Example Growth of a 1,000 KLIMA Stake:  
| Time Period  | Points (Week 1 Entry) |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Day 1**   | 2,000  |
| **Month 1** | 2,164  (+8.2%) |
| **Month 3** | 2,568  (+28.4%) |
| **Month 6** | 3,244  (+62.2%) |
| **Month 12** | 5,400 (+170%) |

---

## Burn Calculation  
\[
\text{Total Burn} = \text{Base Burn} + \text{Time-Based Burn}
\]

- **Base Burn = 25% of staked amount**  
- **Time-Based Burn** = min\((\text{Days Staked} / 365) \times 75\%, 75\%\)  
- **Maximum Total Burn = 100%**  

### Example Burn Scenarios:  
| Exit Time  | Base Burn | Time-Based Burn | Total Burn |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Day 30**  | 25.0% | 6.2% | 31.2% |
| **Day 180** | 25.0% | 37.0% | 62.0% |
| **Day 365** | 25.0% | 75.0% | 100.0% |

**Why does Klima 2.0 use a burn mechanism?**  
- It **discourages early exits** by increasing exit costs over time.  
- **Unstaking burns KLIMA**, benefiting those who stake longer.  

---

## What’s the minimum stake amount?  
There is no minimum stake amount.  

## Will there be a UI for tracking points and allocations?  
Yes!  

---

## What are the new tokens in Klima 2.0?  

- **$KLIMA** – Backed by carbon credits, used for minting & retiring carbon.  
- **$KLIMAX** – Economic governance token for managing carbon portfolio & influencing $KLIMA issuance rates.  

## What does staking do in Klima 2.0?  
Stakers help decide:  
- **$KLIMA Staking** – Determines the base pricing of carbon assets.  
- **$KLIMAX Staking** – Modulates trading capacity & risk management.  

## What does Klima 2.0 do with fees?  
Fees are redistributed via the **"Yield Waterfall"**, which allocates protocol fees to:  
- **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**  
- **$KLIMA stakers**  
- **$KLIMAX stakers**  
- **$KLIMAX burns**  

---

## How is Klima 2.0 sustainable?  
- Generates protocol fees through **carbon swaps & liquidity pools**.  
- 100% of collected fees are redistributed via the **Yield Waterfall**.  

## How are incentives structured?  
$KLIMA is **perpetually mintable**, ensuring continuous incentives for:  
1. **$KLIMA stakers** (base yield)  
2. **Liquidity providers** (market rewards)  
3. **$KLIMAX stakers** (emission rewards)  

---

## What is the purpose of the bond market?  
- **$KLIMA stakers** must **lock tokens** to receive yield.  
- **Bond market generates floating rate returns** via zero-coupon instruments.  
- **Floating rates inform forward carbon pricing.**  

## How does Klima 2.0 manage risk?  
- **Risk is managed through staker-driven allocations.**  
- **Minting aligns with impact assets favored by stakers.**  

## How does Klima 2.0 standardize carbon assets?  
1. **Classifies carbon assets** (methodology, region, vintage, issuer).  
2. **Creates fungible carbon tokens.**  
3. **Automates issuance & retirement.**  

---

## How will Klima transition to 2.0?  
1. **Fair launch begins**.  
2. **Migration of existing carbon assets**.  
3. **New market mechanisms introduced**.  
4. **Governance decentralization post-2.0 launch**.  
5. **Carbon asset classes are whitelisted/blacklisted**.  
6. **Market integrations roll out**.  

## What is the endgame of Klima 2.0?  
Klima 2.0 aims to become the **primary venue for global environmental asset liquidity**.  
- **Currently, Klima holds ~1% of the voluntary carbon market.**  
- **With synthetic pricing & liquidity incentives, Klima can attract the remaining 99%.**  

> *"A tail-wag-dog effect may occur where the off-chain carbon market looks at Klima’s prices for real-time information. Then we win."*
