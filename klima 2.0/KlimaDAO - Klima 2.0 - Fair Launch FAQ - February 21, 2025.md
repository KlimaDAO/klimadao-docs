# KlimaDAO Fair Launch - Intro FAQ  

*"Markets are superb at setting prices, but incapable of recognizing the price of their success."*  

## What is Klima 2.0?  

Klima 2.0 is a redesigned decentralized carbon market aimed at enhancing carbon pricing, retirement, and offset mechanisms. Our new model introduces a bond market, an economic governance token **$KLIMAX**, a synthetic pricing model for carbon credits, and an Automated Asset Manager (AAM) that facilitates pricing and liquidity for tokenized carbon assets via **$KLIMA**.  

## What is an Automated Asset Manager?  

An **Automated Asset Manager (AAM)** is a collection of smart contracts that facilitate pricing and trading of assets. Klima is applying this technology to carbon credits. The AAM enables carbon asset issuers to access deep liquidity through synthetic pricing of real-world assets (RWAs) using **$KLIMA** and **$KLIMAX**.  

## What is the Fair Launch?  

The Fair Launch is a program to transition the restructuring of the legacy **$KLIMA** token.  

**$KLIMA holders** can stake their legacy tokens to receive the new Klima 2.0 tokens (**$KLIMA + $KLIMAX**). New **$KLIMA** is distributed pro-rata upon relaunch, calculated as a share of **$KLIMA staked**. **$KLIMAX** is distributed pro-rata upon relaunch, calculated as share of **points accrued**. Stake early and **earn more points**. Stake longer, **earn more points**. Unstake, and an increasing share of **$KLIMA** is burned. Points lost from unstaking are **redistributed to remaining stakes**. Any **$KLIMA** not staked will not be eligible for new **$KLIMA** on relaunch.  

## What if I don't stake?  

Unstaked **$KLIMA** tokens will maintain their **1:1 BCT backing**, but will **not receive any allocation of new $KLIMA or $KLIMAX tokens**.  

## Why wouldn't I stake?  

To maintain an option on short-term **$KLIMA** price volatility.  

## What happens to legacy $KLIMA after relaunch?  

Staked tokens are permanently locked and replaced with new token allocations.  

Unstaked tokens maintain **1:1 BCT backing** and can still be retired or traded.  

## When exactly does staking start?  

Staking details will be announced on the official **Discord** and **Twitter**.  

## When exactly does staking end?  

Staking ends when the Klima 2.0 protocol is **ready for deployment**.  

Current projections are **Q3 2025**.  

## Can I add more $KLIMA to my stake over time?  

**Yes!**  

## How are points calculated exactly?  

**Base Points Calculation**  

Daily Points = Staked Amount × e^(0.00274 × Days) × Entry Bonus

where **Entry Bonus** is:  
- **2.0x** for **Week 1** participants  
- **1.5x** for **Week 2** participants  
- **1.0x** for all subsequent participants  

### Example Growth of a 1,000 KLIMA Stake  

| Time Period  | Points (Week 1 Entry) |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Day 1**   | 2,000  |
| **Month 1** | 2,164  (+8.2%) |
| **Month 3** | 2,568  (+28.4%) |
| **Month 6** | 3,244  (+62.2%) |
| **Month 12** | 5,400 (+170%) |

## Burn Calculation  

Total Burn = Base Burn + Time-Based Burn

where:  

- **Base Burn = 25% of staked amount**  
- **Time-Based Burn** = `min((Days Staked / 365) × 75%, 75%)`  
- **Maximum Total Burn = 100%**  

### Example Burn Scenarios  

| Exit Time  | Base Burn | Time-Based Burn | Total Burn |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Day 30**  | 25.0% | 6.2% | 31.2% |
| **Day 180** | 25.0% | 37.0% | 62.0% |
| **Day 365** | 25.0% | 75.0% | 100.0% |

## How is the burn calculated exactly?  

The burn mechanism creates **increasing exit costs over time**, reinforcing a **"last man standing"** dynamic. When a participant unstakes early, the system calculates and executes a burn that grows with time staked. **It’s really hot.**  

## What’s the minimum stake amount?  

There is no minimum stake amount.  

## Will there be a UI for tracking points/allocations?  

**Yes.**  

## What are the new tokens in Klima 2.0?  

- **$KLIMA**: Represents a claim on the underlying carbon portfolio. Can be minted in exchange for carbon, and can be burned to obtain carbon retirement certificates.  

- **$KLIMAX**: Economic governance token for carbon portfolio management, influencing **$KLIMA** issuance and retirement rates.  

## What does staking do in Klima 2.0?  

Both sets of token stakers must answer one ‘simple’ question:  

**“Which environmental assets should $KLIMA buy more of?”**  

- **$KLIMA staking**: Determines the base pricing of carbon assets.  
- **$KLIMAX staking**: Modulates trading capacity and risk management.  

## What does Klima 2.0 do with fees?  

The protocol redistributes fees along a **"Yield Waterfall"**, which allocates **100% of the protocol’s fees and emissions** to users, including:  

- **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**  
- **$KLIMA Stakes**  
- **$KLIMAX Stakes**  
- **$KLIMAX Burns**  

## How is Klima 2.0 sustainable?  

Klima 2.0 is designed to generate protocol fees by **enabling spot carbon swaps and synthetically settling carbon liquidity** in **$KLIMA** pools. All collected fees are distributed to stakeholders via the **Yield Waterfall**.  

## How will Klima transition to 2.0?  

The transition will be executed **incrementally**:  

1. **Fair launch begins**.  
2. **Migration of existing carbon assets**.  
3. **Introduction of new market mechanisms**.  
4. **Immediate decentralization of governance post 2.0 deployment**.  
5. **Gradual rollout of market carbon integrations**.  

## What is the end-game of Klima 2.0?  

Klima 2.0 aims to become the **primary venue for global environmental asset liquidity**.  

$KLIMA currently has just under 1% of the total voluntary carbon market as TVL - and with our synthetic pricing model and evergreen incentives, we can provide the price feed and liquidity to attract the other 99%. A “tail-wag-dog” effect may occur where the entire off-chain carbon market is looking at Klima’s prices to find real-time information on market structure. Then we win.
