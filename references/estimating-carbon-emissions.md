# Estimating Carbon Emissions

## Air Travel

The most authoritative source for estimated emissions associated with commercial air travel is this calculator from ICAO: [https://applications.icao.int/icec/Home/Index](https://applications.icao.int/icec/Home/Index)

For private air travel, emissions are substantially higher and highly dependent on the aircraft flown and number of passengers.

## Personal Annual Emissions

Based on widely available statistics for many countries, it is possible for individual consumers to estimate their emissions by filling in details about their lifestyle into a form like these:

* General-purpose global calculator: [https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx)
* Official USA EPA calculator for US-based individuals: [https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/)

## On-Chain Transactions

* [carbon.fyi](https://carbon.fyi) is an easy-to-use interface for estimating emission from Ethereum mainnet transactions
  * NOTE: emissions are approximately 0 since the Merge, only 800 tonnes annually for the entire network, so addresses with no pre-merge transactions will show 0 emissions
  * KlimaDAO has also developed a Dune query suitable for estimating emissions from an arbitrarily large batch of addresses, based on the same emissions estimate as carbon.fyi here: [https://dune.com/queries/1582379](https://dune.com/queries/1582379)
