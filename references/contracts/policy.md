# Policy

The policy contract is an address guarded by a simple Gnosis safe implementation. The policy address manages adjustments of the monetary policy of the KlimaDAO protocol. This includes BCV and reward rate adjustments.&#x20;

Access to the policy address is controlled by a 3 of 5 multi-sig held by members of the Core Team. Changes made via the policy address are either voted on by the token holders specifically as a KIP, or implemented under a specific power delegated to the Policy Team via a KIP.
