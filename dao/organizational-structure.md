# Organizational Structure

## Organs of the DAO

* Foundation President:&#x20;
* Foundation Directors:&#x20;
* Protocol Team: key contributors most of whom have been working on KlimaDAO since before launch. Establishes strategic vision and provide expert input on carbon markets and DeFi. Guides the DAO's decentralization plan and ensures functional teams are aligned on priorities, collaborate productively, and deliver on their objectives.
* Bounty Hunter: all applicants to be a DAO contributor automatically become Bounty Hunters. Bounty Hunters have access to the internal DAO bounty board, and are welcome to contribute to small projects and complete bounties without guaranteed compensation\* - until a department has the resources to tap them in as a Bounty Contributor or Internal Contributor.
* Token Holders: core stakeholders of KlimaDAO, our Klimate community plays a critical role supporting the protocolâ€™s growth and engaging in the governance process via discussion and voting.
* Partners: organizations who have established a relationship with KlimaDAO. Some Partners utilize our products and/or hold KLIMA on their balance sheets; some also contribute on joint initiatives.

_\*NOTE: By default, bounties will only be available to licensed Bounty Hunters who have applied to work on a bounty and been assigned that bounty by a Functional Steward. However, some bounties may be available to community members who have not been tapped in, and will be flagged as such. For example, the_ [_standing bug bounty for exploits_](../developers/bug-bounty.md) _that place funds at risk is available to any community member who follows the documented procedure for claiming that bounty._
