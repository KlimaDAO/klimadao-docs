# Core Team Roles & Structure

## Structure & Governance

KlimaDAO Core Team consists of the project’s co-founders, and individuals deemed to have the skills, delivery track record and demonstrated merit to contribute to KlimaDAO's long-term strategic mission.&#x20;

The existing mechanism for on-boarding new members to Core is via a majority vote held by the existing Core members. The vote is an informed decision making process, with existing Core members having full insight into the prospective member’s track record - both in terms of their contributions to the DAO, and their previous experiences. The existing mechanism to relieve Core members of their duties is via a majority vote by Core team members.&#x20;
