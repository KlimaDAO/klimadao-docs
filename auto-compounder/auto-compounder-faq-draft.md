# Auto Compounder FAQ (DRAFT)

## Where does the yield come from?

Aerodrome issues its native AERO token to all participants of liquidity pools on the platform. More information can be found at [https://aerodrome.finance/docs#](https://aerodrome.finance/docs).

## What is the advantage of using the auto-compounder over Aerodrome’s native offering?

On Aerodrome, you have to manually claim your AERO emissions as they accumulate over time. Depending on your goals, this can be sub-optimal: if you want to grow your open position by re-staking your AERO tokens, you would have to go through this process manually–ideally many times per day to optimize for the effects of compound interest.

KlimaDAO’s auto-compounder accesses your accumulated AERO rewards, converts them to the tokens of your open position, and re-stakes them automatically into your position. Through compound interest, this can improve the overall yield performance of your position.

## How often is the yield compounded?
