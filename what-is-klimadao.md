# What is KlimaDAO?

## Klima is protocol.

Klima is a [DeFi](https://ethereum.org/defi) protocol composed of multiple [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/smart-contracts) on the Polygon PoS public blockchain. These smart contracts are designed to work together to form a larger protocol with the aim of aligning each stakeholder's incentives toward growing the digital carbon market (DCM) and accelerating climate financing.

The Klima protocol issues the $KLIMA token which is utilized in many ways in the protocol to incentivize activity and by KLIMA token holders to vote and govern the protocol and its treasury.

## KLIMA is a token.

$KLIMA is an ERC-20 token deployed on the Polygon PoS public blockchain. $KLIMA is the entry point to the Digital Carbon Market. Every $KLIMA token is backed by at least one carbon tonne in the KlimaDAO treasury. A new KLIMA token can only be minted by putting a tonne of digital carbon in the KlimaDAO treasury.

KLIMA token serves multiple purposes:&#x20;

* KLIMA provides the liquidity for the Digital Carbon Market via protocol owned liquidity.
* KLIMA can be staked to hedge against ecosystem inflation.
* KLIMA is the primary mechanism for the treasury to acquire digital carbon (referred to as “reserve assets”) and liquidity (referred to as “assets”) through bonding.
* KLIMA can be used to redeem and retire digital carbon via the retirement aggregator and retirement bonds.

## KlimaDAO is a DAO.

KlimaDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): a social coordination layer, where the success of its mission is determined by how you and other participants affect it and get involved. Its unique incentive system and its [governance process](https://klimadao.finance/governance) exist to drive effective participation and engagement, priming KlimaDAO to solve precisely the type of coordination failure that has compromised our planet’s climate and ecosystems.

KlimaDAO governs the protocol and its treasury, seeds liquidity pools, and enables layers of technology infrastructure to route through a flourishing ecosystem.

### Built for you – who uses KlimaDAO, and how you can leverage it to drive impact <a href="#viewer-r8op" id="viewer-r8op"></a>

Addressing coordination failure means bringing together diverse actors and enabling them to fulfill their objectives. Since launching in 2021, KlimaDAO has built a wealth of resources and tooling designed to enable users to get involved and drive impact.

**Key user groups fall under five broad categories:**

#### Governance

DCM stakeholders can leverage the DAO as a coordination engine. The journey starts with [acquiring $KLIMA](https://klimadao.finance/buy) – as the $KLIMA token can be used to participate in KlimaDAO’s [governance process](https://klimadao.finance/governance), deciding on KlimaDAO’s allocation of its Treasury and its market-making capabilities. Users can navigate to the [Forum](https://forum.klimadao.finance/), to take part in this consensus-forming process.

#### Infrastructure

Users can leverage KlimaDAO’s native tooling to navigate the DCM and its opportunities. Users can stake their $KLIMA to hedge against ecosystem inflation, acquire $KLIMA at a discount through bonds by supplying digital carbon to the Treasury, retire credits to drive environmental impact, and navigate the DCM using [Klima Data](https://data.klimadao.finance/).

#### Ecosystem

With people continuing to build on top of KlimaDAO’s underlying open base layer, users can navigate their way through the different applications and DCM services available via the Ecosystem hub.
